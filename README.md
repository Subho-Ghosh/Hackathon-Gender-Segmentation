# Hackathon-Gender-Segmentation
# Classify observations based on browsing traits

There are specifically 3 files with data columns linked by unique keys. The keys are spread across training and test set.
The implementation uses several parametric as well as non-parametric binary classification algorithms in addition to using a neural network with dynamic(based on number of input variables) hidden layer inputs

### Neural Network outperforms other methods in terms of generalization. Even with a training accuracy of around 60% the NN model predicts the correct gender 80% of the time!
